Hello Dr.Hosseinkhani,

This is Sobhan Zamani with student ID 402111574. Initially, when selecting my project topic, I intended to work with an Economics minor and had chosen a topic related to Economics. 
However, based on your comments in class that we could change our topic, I did so and created an AI agent based on historical figures' data.
In this agent, the data is stored as a graph using Neo4j. For processing user input and generating output responses using the dataset, I have utilized version 3.2 of Llama and Ollama.
